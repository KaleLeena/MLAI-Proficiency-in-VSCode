🚀 Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Practical Experience

I'm excited to share my hands-on journey through a comprehensive set of ML & AI practicals, where I explored and implemented key algorithms and techniques fundamental to the field of data science and AI. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of model performance, evaluation metrics, and data interpretation.

🔍 Practical Highlights:

📈 Linear Regression – Implemented predictive modeling using linear relationships and evaluated model accuracy.

🔄 Logistic Regression – Applied binary classification on datasets, exploring decision boundaries and probability outputs.

📍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – Classified data using proximity-based learning and tested model sensitivity to k-values.

🌳 Decision Trees – Built interpretable tree models to classify data and visualized decision rules.

🧠 Naive Bayes – Utilized probabilistic learning for classification tasks, with a focus on text data.

🧲 Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Implemented margin-based classification and explored kernel trick for non-linear separation.

🌲 Random Forest – Leveraged ensemble learning for robust classification and feature importance analysis.

🛠️ Weka AI Tool – Installed and explored Weka for data mining, preprocessing, and model training using a GUI-based interface.

📊 Data Analysis with Correlation Matrix – Examined relationships among features to inform model design.

✅ Data Analysis with Confusion Matrix – Evaluated classification models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

💡 Skills & Tools Used:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Weka

🔗 This experience has significantly strengthened my foundation in applied ML & AI and given me confidence in building intelligent systems with real-world data.
